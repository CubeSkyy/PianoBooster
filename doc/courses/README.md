*Start With Middle C* is an extremely easy piece. Just find *middle C* on the piano
and then play that note four times using your *thumb* on your *right hand*.
The first half of the piece has *middle C* in the *Treble Clef*,
then for the second half of the piece the same *middle C* note is shown the *Bass Clef*.
Play this using your *thumb* on your *left hand*.

## SkipToMyLoo
![score](BoosterMusic/SkipToMyLoo001.svg)

For *Skip To My Loo* start with both thumbs on *middle C* and then use one finger for each white note on the piano.
So for the first two notes which are *E* you should use the *middle finger* of your right hand.

This piece introduces the use of *both hands* as the melody goes across *middle C*.

Hint: _For the notes in the *treble clef* you always use your *right hand*
and for the *base clef* your *left hand*._
