# Piano Booster metronome patterns

To activate these different metronome patterns copy them over the `Default.txt` metronome pattern file.
On windows this file is in `\Users\<your user name>\AppData\Roaming\PianoBooster\metronome-patterns\Default.txt` and Linux and macOS it is in `~/.config/PianoBooster/metronome-patterns/Default.txt`

Alternatively you can edit the `Default.txt` metronome patten file to suit your needs.
If you do create useful metronome patten please consider sharing it with other users.

The metronome patten files are comma separated variable files (CSV) and they can be created using
the command line programs `midicsv` and `csvmidi`.
Please see https://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/ more information and windows executables are also available on that site.
