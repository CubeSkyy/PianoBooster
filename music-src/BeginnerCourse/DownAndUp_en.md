*Down And Up* is mirror version of the Up And Down piece we played earlier but this version uses your *left hand*.
These are the top five notes of the scale of C major. Again try to use all your fingers.

Use your *thumb* for *C*, your *index finger* for *D*, . . . ,
all the way down to your *little finger* for *G*.


*Hint:* _Make sure you use *every finger* on your *left hand* when playing this
piece._
