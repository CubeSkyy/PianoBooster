Now we are ready to play our first tune, this is a simplified version of *Clair De La Lune*
that uses just three notes *C D* and *E* from your right hand.
First find *middle C* and always uses your *thumb* for this note,
then for *D* use your *first finger* and for *E* and *middle finger*.


*Hint:* _Remember the fingering: Use your *thumb* for *middle C*, your *first finger* for *D*
and *middle finger* for *E*._
