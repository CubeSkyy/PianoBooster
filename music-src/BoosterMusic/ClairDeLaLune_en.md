This is a simplified version of *Clair De La Lune*
that uses only the three notes *C D* and *E* from your right hand.
First find *middle C* and always uses your *thumb* for this note,
then for *D* use your *first finger* and for *E* and *middle finger*.

*Hint:* _If you are a complete beginner try the pieces from the *Beginner Course* first._
